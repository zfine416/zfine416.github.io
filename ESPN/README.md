<h2>ESPN MLB Scoreboard</h2>

<p>Inspiration: I decided to build a scoreboard similar to the famous vintage scoreboard at Fenway Park.</p>

<p>The data feed can be found at www.zacharyfine.space/json/mlb.json</p>

<p>The projects was built with:
<ul>
	<li>HTML/CSS</li>
	<li>jQuery</li>
	<li>Mustache</li>
	<li>Moment.js</li>
</ul>
